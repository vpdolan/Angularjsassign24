## Welcome to My Project
 -->
AngularJS project: building a basic website from scratch, which depicted login/logout activities, inclusion of cookies, and an accessible and editable list of popular breakfast dish recipes.  The tools and frameworks utilized included Javascript, Underscore, JQuery, AngularJS, SASS, Babel, Mocha/Chai, Font-Awesome, Foundation and Parse.  

This project entailed constructing a multitude of modular components in both HTML and JS.  Links were built between the home page, logon page, add/edit page and contact page.  Modular components included JS Services and Controllers as well as HTML Templates.  In addition, gulp, browserify, angular-cookies and angular-ui-router were installed to allow the site greater functionality in an effort to increase user interface satisfaction.
